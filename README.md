# csv3geojson

Faster CSV to GeoJSON that only supports node.js and streams.

It's less user-friendly, not available as a library, not compatible with
browsers, but also a lot faster.

## install

    npm install -g csv3geojson

## usage

csv3geojson takes input from stdin, outputs into stdout, and takes two parameters,
the names of the longitude and latitude columns.

## example

```
~/src/csv3geojsonã€‰time ./csv3geojson LON LAT < ~/Downloads/us/va/statewide.csv > statewide.geojson
./csv3geojson LON LAT < ~/Downloads/us/va/statewide.csv > statewide.geojson  63.35s user 9.62s system 95% cpu 1:16.32 total
